## Part 2 (joined gang)

### The part is not alone - they are accompanied by 3 npcs of the same type, and another one  

1. A coterie of loyalists to the princes of Waterdeep have seized the gate. Get it back,
be rewarded handsomely by Handsome George. Kill everyone inside - Don't care if it's some git from the slums.


You all find yourselves locked up in a dank, fetid cell. Crowded together with each other and a few other ne'er do wells.

there seems to be little order in the streets. Residences belonging to noble sympathizers and the nobles themselves have been ransacked.

Though confident of his new position, he has been squandering his victory with raucous parties that seldom went without destruction of property and even lives. The nobility has purchased the loyalty of the army, and as of this moment are within striking distance of the city gates.
